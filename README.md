# sketchnet

sketchnet - processing code generator

can we teach a computer to draw pictures with code. We use Processing and java/jruby code paired with the pictures it makes to train the system.  The model will then be able to take unseen images generate working code for it.

For more info and results, see the blog post: http://www.jtoy.net/projects/sketchnet/

As far as we know, this should be the first working model to generate working usable code.


# functions we are interested in modeling

* sin/cos
* shapes: ellipse/rect/etc
* line
* bezier
